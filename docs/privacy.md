This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install and use the 'Photopress' Android app (the “App”).


#### PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The app does not use Google Analytics, or any other analytics tools to track usage.

When you log-in to the App, we are provided certain information by Wordpress.com. This information may include your display name, email address and profile photo. The App may also periodically sync with Wordpress.com to retrieve and store your posts, tags, categories, blogs and related information (URLs, folders, dates, etc). We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Account Information.”

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking about this Account Information.


#### HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Your Account information is primarily used for providing the core services in the app - posting and viewing of photo posts on your Wordpress sites.

Your Account Information may also be used to pre-fill fields in the feedback form—only when you use it from within the App. This pre-filled information may be changed or removed by you before submitting the feedback form.

We do not use the Account Information outside of the App for any other purposes.


#### SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We do not share your Personal Information with anyone.

Wordpress.com may collect your information from logins, posts, and other interactions. This information is not controlled or collected by the App. You can read more about how Wordpress.com uses your Personal Information [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/).


#### YOUR RIGHTS

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.

#### DATA RETENTION

We do not collect or store any Account Information outside the App. Any Account Information provided when you login to the App is deleted when you logout from the App, or remove the App.

#### CHANGES

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
